This is a page about me.
## Luc Sauve
Iâ€™m a 21 year old from Essex. I love listening to music and going to concerts. I work midnights building vans so I live on Starbucks. Staying active is important to me so I often workout or play sports like Volleyball or hockey but I'm also a big fan of naps.
